# bike-sharing-pattern-predictor
Udacity nanodegree project, a model that predicts bike sharing pattern for a bike rental company.
In this project, I built a neural network that is used to predict the daily bike rental ridership


## Steps I followed to achieve this are mentioned below:
- Imported necessary libraries
- Loaded and preprocessed the data
- Built the neural network and set the hyperparameters
- Trained it and made the predictions
